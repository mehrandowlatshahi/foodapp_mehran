to run the script from the project root directory run the following cmd

java -jar .\target\mehpact-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

running above command starts a tomcat web server together with the developed web app. 

from a browser go to localhost:8080 to see the web app home page.

It is a minimalistic web app with no css.

I am using Java 1.8.0_25 to run the application
